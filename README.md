In the model selection part, first I tried building models using random forest, xgboost, neural network and naive bayes with parameter tuning for TF-IDF and Count features. But they did not perform well compared with using sequence classification in Keras. I also tried adding different layers in building the model, but it turns out that a relatively easy model already performs quite well for the prediction.
